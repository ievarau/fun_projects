```

Repository has a folder per individual small project. Bellow you can find a list of such projects.

### Available projects ###

#### WORDtoLOGO

This is a Shiny App that takes a word or multiple words (best to use a couple, so it looks nice) and generates a sequence logo-like figure with that word(s).

**Try it out:** [https://ievarau.shinyapps.io/WORDtoLOGO/](https://ievarau.shinyapps.io/WORDtoLOGO/)

Read more in the [README]() of the project.

<!-- #### Random partners ####

The script uses two comma-separated lists as input and generates random pairs. It first tries to include one element from each list, but if one list is longer than the other, remaining elements will be paired too. If the remaining elements is not an odd number, the random element from two lists will be selected for the second time.

#### NCMM Tuesday seminar feedback processor ####

The repository contains a Shiny app to process the feedback given to the presenters of [Center for Molecular Medicine Norway](https://www.med.uio.no/ncmm/english/) (NCMM) Tuesday seminars. The feedback is given by people who attended the seminar by answering [this Google form](https://forms.gle/P1SZi2HnYjBKX1Lz6). The answers are extracted from the Google sheets table for each speaker. This table is then saved and submitted into the Shiny app.
